                                My name is Timothy Attah and I'm a passionate web developer who is also a UI and UX designer from Lagos, Nigeria. My experience has taught me that good design is not created in a moment of inspiration or a bubble. It is an iterative process requiring collaboration between multiple teams and your end users. It is easy to get attached to initial design solutions and forgo research and testing but this rarely works. First solutions are often wrong because in the early stages it is hard to know enough about the problem you are attempting to solve. <br>
                                I give thanks to my mentor "ENAHO MURPHY" who taught me everything I know about programming.
